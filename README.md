# Titanic_survival_prediction
Titanic survival prediction using KNN algorithm


## Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scikit-learn. The model is trained on features like passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, and fare.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumukhacr/titanic-knn-prediction.git
   cd titanic-knn-prediction
